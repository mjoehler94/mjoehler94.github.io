# Matt Oehler's Project Portfolio and Website

I created this website in part to help me overcome my fear of publishing. I've found that doing a formal write up of things that I study really helps the concepts to sink in, but writing has never been one of my strengths. I hope that through publishing to this on a semi-consistent basis will improve my writing skills, increase my willingness to share what I've learned, and improve myself as an overall person/programmer. I'm sure there are many out there like myself that are primarily self taught programmers. I hope that some of my posts can be a useful learning aid for them.
