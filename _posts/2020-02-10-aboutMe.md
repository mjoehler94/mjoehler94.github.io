# About Me

My name is Matt Oehler. I received my bachelors degree in statistics from Brigham Young Univeristy, and now I'm working as a data analyst in Draper, Utah. I specifically work on the fraud detection/prevention team at my company, and I absolutely love it. 

Outside of work, I do my best to live life to its fullest, and I feel incredibly blessed to be surrounded with the means and  opportunities to do so.
I lead a a very active lifestyle, and I'm currently participating in several recreation sports leagues for basketball, volleyball, and ultimate frisbee. Other things I enjoy include hiking, wakeboarding, learning everyday, and programmer memes.

I'm also lucky to be married to an incredible woman who supports me in all that I do and even competes alongside me in several of the sports leagues I just mentioned.

The reason for creating this website is n-fold: 
to host several of my cleaned up side projects serving as a portfolio of sorts
to help me develop a habit of consistently writing and publishing what I learn so that the concepts stick better
to help me learn the basics of web development
and to contribute to the online community. 
I'm sure there are many out there like myself that are primarily self taught programmers. I hope that some of my posts can be a useful learning aid for them.

I created this website primarily to host my completed side projects, serving as a portfolio to showcase some of the skills that I have learned.

I created this website in part to help me overcome my fear of publishing. I've found that doing a formal write up of things that I study really helps the concepts to sink in, but writing has never been one of my strengths. I hope that through publishing to this on a semi-consistent basis will improve my writing skills, increase my willingness to share what I've learned, and improve myself as an overall person/programmer. I'm sure there are many out there like myself that are primarily self taught programmers. I hope that some of my posts can be a useful learning aid for them.
